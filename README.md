# uptime
A simple PHP script to monitor a server and send a notification via Telegram bot when it is unreachable.<br/>
This script pings a website to check if it is online and it does not receive a response from the website within the specified time (timeout) the webpage it sends a notification<br />



The script can be set a cronjob to run at specified intervals.<br/>
Uptime is lightweight so it can be hosted on a shared hosting.
